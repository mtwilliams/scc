## Intro

:construction: This is a work in progress! :construction:

SCC is a modern cross-compiler toolchain.

Heavily inspired by LLVM, SCC is built around the a common intermediate representation and provides a framework for the development of frontends, backends, and optimizers, analyzers, debuggers, and more.

It is far from complete, but since competition sucks, it will be no less production ready in the near future.
